# Notes on Development Books

This repo is a collection of notes and personal opinions on books for developers.
Initially this collection was created in 2016, as an easy way to answer the question "What books would you recommend to buy for office/ to read to become better .Net developer?"
Originally it was a single .xlsx file, for russian-speaking audiences only.

### Current notes:
